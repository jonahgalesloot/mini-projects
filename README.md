# Mini-Projects & Logic Sketches

- **Purpose:** A lot of my coding projects are quick explorations of a technology, and thus will stay in my folders forever. However, there are a select few that I believe deserve to be immortalised in Github due to their unique ideation, and are kept in this collection of my favourite mini-projects

---

### **The Collection**

- **[Project Name A](./folder-a)**: **[Short Hook]** — .
- **[Project Name B](./folder-b)**: **[Short Hook]** — (e.g., A CLI tool that converts Spotify playlists into markdown).
- **[Project Name C](./folder-c)**: **[Short Hook]** — (e.g., A minimalist pomodoro timer for the terminal).

**Quick Setup**

1. Clone this repository:
```powershell
git clone github.com

2. Navigate to a specific project folder:
```powershell
cd project-folder-name

3. Install any dependencies and run the program!
