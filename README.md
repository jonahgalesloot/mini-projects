# Mini-Projects

- **Purpose:** A lot of my coding projects are quick explorations of a technology, and thus will stay in my computer's SSD forever. However, there are a select few that I believe deserve to be immortalised in Github due to their unique ideation, and are kept in this collection of my favourite mini-projects

### **The Collection**

- **[Mandelbrot Text Renderer](./mandelbrot_text)**: — Interactive Python CLI-only Mandelbrot Set display
- **[Pi to Music](./pi_music)**: A sonic mnemonic (sorry for the rhyme) for memorising digits of Pi by mapping them to a pentatonic scale melody
- **[CLI Wordle](./terminal_wordle)**: A CLI-based Wordle game with an interactive UI and difficulty selection and dictionary definition features
- **[Sneaky Prank](./stealth_jumpscare)**: A jumpscare prank on a random interval, using a particularly bad drawing by my friend
